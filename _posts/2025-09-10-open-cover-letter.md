title:  "Open Cover Letter 2025"

Dear potential employer, referrer, or recruiter,

I have spent the last two years (as of August 2025) attempting to form a digital identity startup specializing in the [Key Event Receipt Infrastructure](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/) and the [vLEI](https://www.gleif.org/en/organizational-identity/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei/gleif-ebook-the-vlei-introducing-digital-i-d-for-organizations-everywhere).  We had a lot of fun, created a lot of interesting prototypes, contributed to the open source community and various standards bodies to which we were a part, and wrote our own implementations of KERI and the associated specs.  Ultimately though, we failed to find our way to sustainable profits.  From this experience I have come to consider myself one of the top ten KERI experts in the world!  If only because there are probably only ten KERI experts in the world. :D

Before that I plied the trade of applied machine learning practitioner.  When I started my career the title "data scientist" didn't exist but once it gained prominence it is the title that I’ve been most attracted to alongside “programmer” which is what I’ve always considered myself.  During my career I’ve worn the proverbial “hats” of business analyst, statistician-lite, and machine learning engineer as well those of sales engineer, data engineer, quality assurance engineer, model monitoring analyst, forensic analyst, and database administrator from time to time.

I’ve specialized in entity-resolution/data-matching, problems suitable to knowledge graphs or graph based algorithms, and its application to credit risk for the most part, but have also worked on projects involving natural language processing, unsupervised learning, fraud detection, anomaly detection, security models, behavioral analysis, and even some internal pure machine learning research projects.

I get along in any environment but prefer and enjoy working in agile, small teams, with skilled team mates.  I find startups with grand visions very compelling.  The lottery-ticket of stock options or RSUs is appealing as is the lifestyle of working hard on a variety of interesting problems rather than being constrained to just one.  Large bureaucracies are less preferable to me as are some of the more pigeonholed positions one comes to find in large enterprises.

Currently, I can only accept roles that are remote or within commuting distance of the Charlotte Metropolitan area but have reached compromises in the past with employers to spend a week or so every other month with the teams onsite to build rapport.  I don't mind traveling in and of itself but after some travel intensive jobs early in my career I decided that I won't travel more than 25% of the time barring some extraordinary reasons to do so.  It gets old to live in a hotel after you've been there a month and that’s not an environment where I feel that I thrive.

Industries I'd consider include (but aren't limited to), fintech, natural science based opportunities, insurance, crypto, security, and particularly digital identity which I've developed a passion for (even for non-KERI/non-vLEI stuff).  I probably won't consider jobs in advertising and marketing, creepy surveillance startups (at odds with my skills in entity-resolution I know), or things that just don't seem like they have much social utility.  It's fun to catch bad guys, build things that will help people stay secure, keep their privacy, or even save them a few dollars by making more accurate credit models.  It's not fun to do things like spy on workers all the time or try and get consumers to purchase more toothpaste via nudges or whatever.

I'll add this in because many recruiters seem to spray and pray, I am a terrible web developer (maybe equivalent to a junior).  You probably don't want to hire me for that role even if I wanted to though I can do it in a pinch.

Interesting problems are my driving motivation in seeking employment and social utility is the second.  Compensation is third but I expect the market rate.  Anyone worth hiring typically wants some particular combination of those things I think and any employer worth working for can usually provide interesting problems, clear social utility, and pay market rate or grant options/stock that may be valuable in the future.  If an employer can meet that threshold, I've often found that things like decent team mates, good bosses, and a few perks are table stakes to the core mission.

I hope this letter helps in your decision to approach me or not approach if it doesn’t seem like a fit.  If it does seem like a fit or you have questions for me, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me at `<my first name>.<my last name>@gmail.com` or via Linkedin. I can provide my phone number on request. If you are looking to hire someone with a particular skill set somewhat within my realm of expertise please don't hesitate to ask either. Always glad to connect skilled people with employers who are seeking them.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and I look forward to hearing from you, 

Charles Lanahan
